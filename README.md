# stupidSpace2DGame
should just need pygame and time and random pip libraries

run 
`python main.py`

the collision is buggy, this is because sometimes the gravity velocity is so great it messes with collision algorythm
I can fix this by swapping the move character and collision algorythms then add some things to adjust character location properly
